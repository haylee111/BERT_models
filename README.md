# BERT Finetuned Models - FinBERT 
This repository contains fine tuned BERT models.

FinBERT is fine tuned on a pre trained BERT-BASE-CASED model. It let's you run sentiment classification [Positive, Negative and Neutral] on finance domain data. For details, please read the [original paper here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.10063.pdf).

All the required steps to use this model are given in - [Running finBERT - How To.ipynb](https://github.com/ipuneetrathore/BERT_models/blob/master/Running%20finBERT%20-%20How%20To.ipynb) 

Model is available at - https://huggingface.co/ipuneetrathore/bert-base-cased-finetuned-finBERT
